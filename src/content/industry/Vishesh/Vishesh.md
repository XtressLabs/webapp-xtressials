<column md="6" lg="8" offset_lg="1">

You are continually exposed to different skills, perspectives, thinking styles, and cultures that people bring from their lived experiences. This all contributes to really considering all these variables embodied in actual people, before you even get to talking to target users. That really builds the team empathy muscle, which we need as a company to build products our clients will choose to use, not just forced on them by their corporate policy. Plus, it really creates a collaborative, creative, and inspiring environment to work in, too.
