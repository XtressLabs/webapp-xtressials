I’m passionate about this topic. I conducted my thesis research, “The Bold Principle,” on diversity and creativity. Diversity comes in many varieties beyond the common identity factors. However, in my work I examined the perceptions of black designers when it comes to creativity. My efforts were in search of new approaches to design creativity and highlight underrepresented voices. From this work and my own experience, I believe the advantages of diverse teams are plentiful, yet can only be tapped into if the conditions—such as the environment: culture, inclusion, opportunity—also embrace diversity. At which point, we can see advantages.

One, diversity begets diversity, meaning that different types of diversity—from identity to character—attract other differences and position our teams for better outcomes because of the richness in the teams’ skills, experiences, perspectives, and more.

Two, diversity raises the bar. Significant research has shown that diverse teams yield better performance that those that are not. Diverse perspectives offer difference and dissention which can provide opportunity for the critique and rigor of our thinking that ultimately informs what we create for a continually changing world. 
Three, diversity reveals truths. There is no one single truth from a human experience perspective. To get us closer to those truths, it is a must that a range of human experiences are embraced.
